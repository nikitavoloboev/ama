<h1 align="center"> About me ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I love reading AMA's [done by other people](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) and I love answering questions whatever those questions may be.

I am currently focused on building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) which is an [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website that tries to organise world's knowledge and provide study plans for learning anything in the most efficient way possible.

And I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built.

<h1 align="center"> Guidelines ðŸ“• </h1>

- check if your question hasn't already been answered
- use a succinct title and description
- be nice :)
