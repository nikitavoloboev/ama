**Anything means anything.** Work, programming, tech, personal life.. Whatever you want to know, this is the place to ask!

## About me
I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) things.

Currently building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), an [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) for learning any topic on Earth as fast as possible.

I love [solving problems with code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github.html) and sharing what I know in my [blog](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) and [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

If you have any questions that you want to ask me, [please ask](../../issues/new). ðŸ’œ

## Guidelines
- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
