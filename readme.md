## About me
I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built with the world.

I am currently building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) which is an [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website that tries to organise world's knowledge and provide study plans for learning anything in the most efficient way possible.

And I love [solving problems with code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github.html) and sharing what I know in my [blog](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and in my [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

If you have any questions that you want to ask me, [please do](../../issues/new). ðŸ’œ
