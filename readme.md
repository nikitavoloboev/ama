## About me
I love reading AMA's [done by other people](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) and I love answering questions whatever those questions may be.

I am currently focused on building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) which is an [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) website that tries to organise world's knowledge and provide study plans for learning anything in the most efficient way possible.

And I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/sharing.html) things I have built.

If you have any questions that you want to ask me, [please do](../../issues/new). ðŸ’œ
