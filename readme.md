# About me ðŸ‘‹

I love reading AMA's [done by other people](https://github.com/sindresorhus/amas) and I love answering questions whatever those questions may be.

I am currently focused on providing [most efficient study plans](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map) on learning any topic on Earth as an interactive Mind Map that all can explore and contribute to. 

I am also building [a search engine](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge-map-search-engine) for all these mind maps. 

I love [macOS and productivity](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) and I love working on projects and new ideas.
