# Ask Me Anything

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Ask any question you have or read past questions asked. I'll gladly answer any question. ♥️

Aside from GitHub, you can also ask a question on [rep.ly](https://rep.ly/nikitavoloboev) or by simply mentioning me with `@` on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev).

I think repl.ly has nicer interface to both read and ask questions & you can ask questions anonymously there if you like.

## About me

I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing) things.

Currently building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), a place for learning any topic and sharing ideas.

I love [solving problems with code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github) and sharing what I know as [articles](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles) and [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

## Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
