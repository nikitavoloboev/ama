I do love reading AMA's done by other people and I love answering questions whatever those questions may be.

I am currently studying Computer Science and am very interested in application development as I really [love](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) well made appliations and tools. I have two app ideas that I am really excited to build and share with the world thus I am learning Swift and what it means to develop for iOS and macOS as I most often prefer native apps over web applications.
