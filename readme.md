# [Ask Me Anything](https://rep.ly/nikitavoloboev)

Ask any question you have or read past questions asked on [rep.ly](https://rep.ly/nikitavoloboev).

I think repl.ly has nicer interface to both read and ask questions & you can ask questions anonymously there if you like.

## Past GitHub questions

I've answered some 50+ questions on GitHub already that you can read [here](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

You can also [ask questions here](../../issues/new) still.

## About me

I love [making](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing) things.

Currently building [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz), a place for learning any topic and sharing novel ideas.

I love [solving problems with code](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github) and sharing what I know as [articles](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-articles) and [wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

Please [ask any question you have](https://rep.ly/nikitavoloboev), I'll gladly answer them. ♥️

## Guidelines
