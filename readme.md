# Ask Me Anything

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Ask any question you have or read past questions asked. I'll gladly answer anything. ♥️

Aside from GitHub, you can also ask questions to me on [X](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev).

## About me

I love [making](https://nikiv.dev/projects) and [sharing](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/) things.

My current focus is on building [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) & [KusKus](https://kuskus.app).

I share [everything I know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/everything-I-know) in a [wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev).

## Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite.
